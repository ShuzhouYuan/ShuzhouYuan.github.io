## Hey! ðŸ¤“

<img class="avatar" src="/images/me_2.jpeg" alt="avatar">

Iâ€™m Shuzhou Yuan, a PhD candidate in Computer Science at [Technische UniversitÃ¤t Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/) and [ScaDS.AI](https://scads.ai), supervised by [Prof. Michael FÃ¤rber](https://sites.google.com/view/michaelfaerber/). My research mainly focuses on Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing.

I obtained my Masterâ€™s degree in Computational Linguistics from [Ludwig-Maximilians-UniversitÃ¤t MÃ¼nchen](https://www.uni-muenchen.de/index.html). Following that, I began my PhD at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in 2022 and transitioned to TU Dresden in 2024 to continue my doctoral research.

### Research Interests:
- Large Language Models
- Graph Neural Networks
